### Shot charts with and without Nikola Mirotic

Since Nikola, has just played 6 games, there's too few shots to make a passable shot chart of Chicago with him, so we will have to rely on team stats to figure what is going on.

```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=12}
Without <- OffShotSeasonGraphTeam(Seasondata = WONM, team = "Chi") + ggtitle("Offensive without Mirotic")
With <- OffShotSeasonGraphTeam(Seasondata = NM, team = "Chi", quant = 0.05)+ ggtitle("Offensive with Mirotic")

grid.arrange(Without, With, ncol = 1)
```

### Stats without Nikola Mirotic

As seen in the table bellow, before Nikola Mirotic came back, the Bulls ranked 27th in the league in Adjusted points per shot made to a more respectable 14th. The defense has not changed all that much, but they improved a tick going from being 15th to 13th in adjusted points allowed per shot. 

```{r}
statsWONM <- SpatialBall2::TeamStats(WONM)
```


```{r}
statsWONM[[1]]$Rank <- 1:30
statsWONM[[2]]$Rank <- 1:30


knitr::kable(dplyr::filter(statsWONM[[1]], TEAM_NAME == "Chi"))
knitr::kable(dplyr::filter(statsWONM[[2]], DefTeam == "Chi"))
```

### Stats with Nikola Mirotic

```{r}
statsNM <- SpatialBall2::TeamStats(NM)
```


```{r}
statsNM[[1]]$Rank <- 1:30
statsNM[[2]]$Rank <- 1:30


knitr::kable(dplyr::filter(statsNM[[1]], TEAM_NAME == "Chi"))
knitr::kable(dplyr::filter(statsNM[[2]], DefTeam == "Chi"))
```

Chicago has diminished the percentage of shots taken from 3 since Mirotic is back, from 36% of their shots taken from beyond the 3 point line to only 26%, the main change for them has been the shooting efficiency. They rose their 2 point shooting pct from 45.7% to 51.5% and their 3 pointers from 34.2% to 38.2%.

```{r}
SpatialBall2::PointShotSeasonGraphPlayer(Seasondata = Season2018, player = "Nikola Mirotic", kernel = FALSE) + ggtitle("Shots taken by Mirotic")
```


Mirotic is shooting and effective field goal percentage of 63% being while having a career 51.1% eFG%. This includes him making over 50% of his 3s, when he is a career 35.5% 3 point shooter. All this while having a 28% usage rate, the highest in his career by far, and shooting all over the court as we see above. All this points to an unsustainable efficiency, and a possible regression to the mean for the Nikola and the Bulls.
