<div id="the-first-team-ever-to-shoot-more-than-half-their-shots-beyond-the-three-point-line" class="section level2">
<h2>The first team ever to shoot more than half their shots beyond the three point line</h2>
<p>For while we`ve been wondering if there is such a thing as too many three pointers for a team. Well we can keep asking ourselves that, as today December the second of 2017, The Rockets are shooting an NBA all-time record 53% of their shots from three point range, followed by last season’s Rockets with 46%. Third place is held by last year’s Cavs team, with 40%, a 13% difference. And it’s not even close to the second, just compare this years Rockets shot chart with 2001 NBA Champions LA Lakers, it’s a completely different sport!</p>
<p><img src="Blog_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>In the plot and table bellow we can see that this year the Rockets are shooting 52 % of their shots from the three point range, followed by the same team of last year. The third place, is last year’s Cavs team, with 40 %, that is a 12% difference!!</p>
<div id="why-keep-jacking-up-threes" class="section level3">
<h3>Why keep jacking up threes?</h3>
<p>Does this make any sense? As we see in figure 1, there is a positive relationship between the percentage of shots a team takes that are three pointers with their points per shot. Actually, if we don’t count the Golden State Warriors teams from 2016, 2017 and this year incarnation of the team, this year Rockets team has the highest Point per shot mark in the last 5 years at 1.12, while making only 36.5% of them.</p>

<h3>What would happend if the warriors shot as many threes as the Rockets</h3>
<p>As told above, this year warriors are the top team in the last 5 years in Points per shot making 1.185 points per shot. They are making an efficient 40.4% of their three pointers and an outstanding 58.5% of their two pointers. But what would happen if they shot they same proportion of their shots form the three point line as the Rockets did?</p>
<p>Well, they would change their PPS to 1.192 which is an increment, but no by so much.</p>

<h3>Is there any downsides on shooting this many three pointers?</h3>
<p>If we look at the proportion of shots a team takes as a proportion of the number of shots their opponent takes as shown in the formula bellow, we see in the following graph (figure 2) that the more threes you take, the less proportions of shots you take. The other team gets more second chances, but the slope of that tendency is a lot lower than the one in Figure 1. That is, usually the proportion of shots you loose by taking more threes is more than offset by the increase in points per shots.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[PropShot =\frac{ShotsTaken_{Offense}}{ShotsAllowed_{Defense}}\]</span></p>
<p>On the other hand, it can still change the outcome of a match. If you see in this years <a href="https://derek-corcoran-barrios.github.io/TeamStats.html">team stats</a>, you will see that even when Golden State has the higher Points per shot in the NBA, it only takes 0.95 shots per every opponent shot. That is why we added the column AdjPPS, which is basically the Points per shot you take adjusted by the proportion of shots taken in a match.</p>
