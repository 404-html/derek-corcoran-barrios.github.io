### Shot charts with and without Nikola Mirotic

Since Nikola, has just played 6 games, there's too few shots to make a passable shot chart of Chicago with him, so we will have to rely on team stats to figure what is going on.

```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=12}
Without <- OffShotSeasonGraphTeam(Seasondata = WONM, team = "Chi") + ggtitle("Offensive without Mirotic")
With <- OffShotSeasonGraphTeam(Seasondata = NM, team = "Chi", quant = 0.05)+ ggtitle("Offensive with Mirotic")

grid.arrange(Without, With, ncol = 1)
```

## [The first team ever to shoot more than half their shots beyond the three point line](https://derek-corcoran-barrios.github.io/Blog)

*December 2nd, 2017*

For while we`ve been wondering if there is such a thing as too many three pointers for a team. Well we can keep asking ourselves that, as today December the second of 2017, The Rockets are shooting an NBA all-time record 53% of their shots from three point range, followed by last season's Rockets with 46%. Third place is held by last yearâ€™s Cavs team, with 40%, a 13% difference. And it's not even close to the second, just compare this years Rockets shot chart with 2001 NBA Champions LA Lakers, it's a completely different sport!
